## About
Vidocracy brings democracy to your party's YouTube videos or music. All guests 
have to do is go to the website on their smartphones and enter a code. They can 
now add YouTube videos/songs to the queue, and vote for those that others have added.

Vidocracy was made with Node.js using Express and Socket.io on the backend, and 
Javascipt using JQuery and Bootstrap in the front end.
